# TIES323 Application Protocols

The assignments are [here](http://users.jyu.fi/~arjuvi/opetus/ties323/2018/demot.html).

## Application protocol implementations

Compiling requires Linux, CMake (>= 3.18), OpenSSL library (>= 3.2?), and [stand-alone Asio C++ library](https://think-async.com/Asio/) (>= 1.28). POP3 client also requires Dear ImGui library for gui, which is included as a git submodule.

### Mail protocols

SMTP, POP3, and IMAP servers are run within a single process, which allows them to access memory-based mail storage. The storage is volatile and will be lost when the server process terminates.

- [x] [IMAP client](/protocols/mail/imap_client)
- [x] [IMAP server](/protocols/mail/smtp_server)
- [x] Extra features
    - POP3 client has TLS option
    - POP3 client has GUI

### File transfer protocols
