# TIES323 Application Protocols

The assignments are [here](http://users.jyu.fi/~arjuvi/opetus/ties323/2018/demot.html).

## Application protocol implementations

Compiling requires Linux, CMake (>= 3.18), OpenSSL library (>= 3.2?), and [stand-alone Asio C++ library](https://think-async.com/Asio/) (>= 1.28). POP3 client also requires Dear ImGui library for gui, which is included as a git submodule.

### Mail protocols

SMTP, POP3, and IMAP servers are run within a single process, which allows them to access memory-based mail storage. The storage is volatile and will be lost when the server process terminates.

- [x] [POP3 client](/protocols/mail/pop3_client)
- [x] [Inbox for SMTP server; POP3 server](/protocols/mail/smtp_server)
- [x] [IMAP client](/protocols/mail/imap_client)
- [x] [IMAP server](/protocols/mail/smtp_server)
- [x] Extra features
    - POP3 client has TLS option
    - POP3 client has GUI
    - Parallelized multi-user SMTP/POP3/IMAP server with transaction locking for POP3

### File transfer protocols

- [x] [FTP client](/protocols/ftp/ftp_client)
- [x] [TFTP client](/protocols/ftp/tftp_client) (Example missing)
- [ ] TFTP server
- [ ] Both RRQ and WRQ for TFTP client and server (1/2)
    - RRQ and WRQ for client
- [ ] Error handling for TFTP
    - Client checks block number
    - Client resends data if ack has wrong opcode or block number
    - Client resends data if ack timeouts
    - Client resends ack if data has wrong opcode or block number, or timeouts
